      "student_answer": "Python is a versatile, high-level programming language widely used in various domains\nsuch as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. It was\ncreated by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is known for its simple syntax,\nwhich makes it easy to read and write, even for beginners. It supports multiple programming\nparadigms, including object-oriented and functional programming. Python has a large\nstandard library and a vibrant community that contributes to thousands of third-party\npackages available via PyPI. Developers use Python for tasks like scripting, machine\nlearning, and building web applications with frameworks like Django and Flask.",
